### Current Progress (Adversaries):

![Progress](https://progress-bar.xyz/94/?style=for-the-badge&scale=129&title=Core_Adversaries&width=1000&color=babaca&prefix=&suffix=/129)

> Work in progress!
> We’re building up a full set of portraits and varied tokens for all adversaries.
> Some tokens might have just 3 variants, others can have 10 or more.
> There’s no “right” number — the important thing is to have at least a few for variety, and usually you’ll see 3–4 per adversary.

# Art for Daggerheart

Art for Daggerheart is a Foundry VTT module that drops fresh, custom-made art straight into your Daggerheart game.
We’re talking unique portraits and tokens for all the adversaries — all AI-generated just for this module.

You get to pick if you want dynamic wildcard tokens that change each time they hit the map, or clean circular tokens for a sharper look.
And if you want extra style, you can add the built-in Foundry Token Rings around them for that “pop” factor.

- **Wildcards Only** – Varied tokens from the `tokens/` folder.
- **Wildcards + Rings** – Varied tokens plus Foundry’s built-in rings.
- **Circle Only** – Circular tokens from the `circle/` folder.
- **Circle + Rings** – Circular tokens plus Foundry’s built-in rings.

## Installation

### Manual Install (until v1.0)

1. Go to **Add-on Modules** in Foundry VTT, **Install Module** and paste this manifest URL in the bottom input:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodra-vr/art-for-daggerheart/refs/tags/test-v0.1.0/module.json
   ```

---

## How It Works

When you start the world, the module checks the **Daggerheart adversaries compendium** and updates each adversary’s portrait and token based on your chosen **Token Mode**.
If Rings are turned on, it applies Foundry’s own Token Rings with the preset style from the module.

---

## Developer Notes

- **`portraits/`** – Portrait images for adversary sheets.
- **`tokens/`** – Wildcard token images with multiple variations.
- **`circle/`** – Circular-masked token images, based on the portraits.
- Matches images to actors by name, ignoring case, accents, and numbering.
- Wildcard mode uses Foundry’s built-in random token selection.
- Ring modes use Foundry’s built-in Token Rings feature with preset colors and scale.
